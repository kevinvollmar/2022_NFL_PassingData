## 2022_NFL_PassingData
 
I downloaded Pro Football Reference's 2022 Individual Passing table and I will be using Python to complete data analysis.

## Project Plan
### Step 1: Data Collection
The first step is to collect the data required for analysis. There are many sources of NFL data, but one of the most popular is the Pro Football Reference. I will be using the 2022 NFL Individual Passing data from the following link: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/passing.htm

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
After collecting the data, the next step is to clean it. Data cleaning involves removing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. This will ensure that the data is ready for analysis. I will need to determine where my outliers are and work to remove them. Providing a definition on what constitutes as an outlier will be required as well.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is the process of analyzing the data to discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. In this step, we will use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize the data and gain insights.

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing data that can help in better predicting the outcome. In this step, we will identify the most important features for our analysis and create new features that may be useful in predicting future outcomes in the 2023 NFL season for passers.

### Step 5: Model Selection
Once we have cleaned the data and engineered new features, we can begin building our models. There are many different types of models that can be used for NFL data analysis, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. In this step, we will select the model that best fits our data.

### Step 6: Model Training
In this step, we will train our selected model using the data we have collected and cleaned. We will use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that our model is accurate and reliable.

### Step 7: Model Evaluation
After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This will help us determine how well our model is performing.

### Step 8: Model Deployment
Once we are satisfied with the performance of our model, we can deploy it in a production environment where it can be used to make predictions.

### Step 9: Project Report and Presentation
Finally, we will prepare a report and presentation to summarize the project and its findings. We will use Jupyter notebooks, PowerPoint, or other tools to create visualizations that effectively communicate our findings to a non-technical audience.
